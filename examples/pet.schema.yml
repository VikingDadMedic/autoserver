### IDL FILE ###
# This file describes how the API should operate.
# It is purposely overly complex, as this example file aims to demonstrate all
# available features.
# A real production file should be much more concise.
# It is based on JSON schema v6 syntax, with some extra attributes
# Using this file, the API will automatically generate:
#  - HTTP server: body/query handling
#  - GraphQL server: endpoint, introspection, debugger, schema printing
#  - CRUD actions: find, create, replace, update, upsert, delete.
#    On a single model or several.
#  - CRUD arguments: filtering (including complex one), sorting, selecting
#  - nested actions, populating
#  - input and output validation
#  - default values, computed values, input/output transformation
#  - automatic attributes: created_time, updated_time, created_by, updated_by
#  - error handling
#  - logging
#  - routing

# IDL file version, required
$schema: tag:apiengine,2017:v1.0.0
# List of models
models:
  # Name of the model, used in routes, e.g. REST endpoints or GraphQL methods
  # Must only be lowercase ASCII letters, digits or underscore.
  # Cannot start with one digit or two underscores.

# Actions can be:
#   - find: retrieve an element, similar to REST's GET
#   - create: create an element, similar to REST's POST.
#     `id` can be specified by client, or set by server.
#   - replace: completely replace an element, similar to REST's PUT
#   - update: partially update an element, similar to REST's PATCH
#   - upsert: if element exists, like "replace". Otherwise, like "create"
#   - delete: delete an element, similar to REST's DELETE
# Each action has two versions:
#   - singular: e.g. `findOne`, similar to REST's GET /models/ID
#   - plural: e.g. `findMany`, similar to REST's GET /models/
# By default, more singular and plural are allowed.
# To restrict to singular only, add `One`, e.g. `findOne`
# Actions can use the following arguments:
#   - `data`:
#      - in update, upsert, replace or create actions. Required by each of them
#      - must be an array of objects for all upsertMany, replaceMany and
#        createMany. Must be an object otherwise
#      - `id` is required for upsert and replace, optional for create,
#        not allowed for update
#      - contains the entities to modify or create
#   - `filter`:
#      - in find, delete and update actions.
#      - must be an object, whose keys are named after the models attributes
#      - can use JSL
#      - for findOne, deleteOne and updateOne, can only contain `id` key,
#        is required, and cannot use JSL
#      - used as a query filter, e.g. deleteMany { filter: { name: 'example' }}
#        remove all entities with `name` 'example'
#   - `order_by`
#      - in all *Many actions. Never required
#      - must be a comma-separated list of attributes, optionally prefixed
#        by + or -, e.g. 'name-,id'
#      - orders server response according to the specified attributes.
#        Default order is +, i.e. ascending
#   - `dry_run` {boolean}
#      - in all actions except find. Never required
#      - if true, the action will not modify the database,
#        but the return value will be the same as if it did
#   - `page_size` {integer}
#      - in findMany, deleteMany or updateMany
#      - defaults to server option defaultPageSize (default: 100)
#      - pagination size.
#      - 0 disables pagination.
#      - maximum is server option maxPageSize (default: 100)
#   - `before|after` {string}
#      - in findMany
#      - retrieves previous|next pagination batch,
#        using the previous response's 'token'
#      - use '' for the start or the end
#   - `page` {integer}
#      - in findMany
#      - page number, for pagination, starting at 1
#      - cannot be used together with `before|after`
# JSL is a restricted syntax of JavaScript:
#   - any string that is surrounded by parenthesis will be interpreted as JSL,
#     except if first parenthesis is escaped:
#      - this is JSL: '(1 + 1)'
#      - this is not JSL: '\(1 + 1)'
#   - it can be used in `filter` (for findMany, updateMany or deleteMany),
#     and in transforms|compute|default
#   - at the moment, any JavaScript is allowed, but this will be restricted
#     (for filters only) in the future
#     for security and performance reasons
#   - it can use helpers (see below)
#   - it can use variables (see below)
# Variables:
#   - parameters passed to any JSL
#   - they are divided into several groups:
#      - helpers and variables
#      - "request variables":
#         - NOW {string} - current date and time
#         - IP {string} - request IP
#         - PARAMS {object} - contains all request parameters:
#           query strings, (application-namespaced) HTTP headers
#      - "interface variables":
#         - COMMAND {string} - current command, among 'create', 'read',
#           'update' or 'delete'
#      - "model variables":
#         - $ {any} - value of current attribute,
#           e.g. { filter: { name: '$ !== "John"' } }
#           checks whether model.name !== 'John'
#         - $$ {object} - current model (input or output),
#           e.g. { filter: { name: '$ === $$.first_name' } }
#           checks whether model.name === model.first_name
#      - "helpers variables" (only available in helpers):
#         - ARG_1, ARG_2, etc. {any} - position parameter when firing
#           the helper function
#      - "validation variables" (only available in validation keywords):
#         - EXPECTED {any} - value passed to the validation rule
#   - restrictions:
#      - arg.filter can only use $ and $$ variables
#      - helpers and variables cannot use "interface variables"
#        nor "model variables"
# Default `commands` values for each model
# If unspecified, is all commands but deleteMany
commands: [create, read, update, delete]
# Helpers are functions that can be used in any JSL.
# Their argument is passed as variables ARG_1, ARG_2, etc. in inline functions
# They must be pure functions, because they are memoized.

  # Helpers use JSL syntax themselves
